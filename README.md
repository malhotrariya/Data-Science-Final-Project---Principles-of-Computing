This project involves using data analysis to explore DNA sequences related to the p53 gene, known for its role in suppressing cancer. It included a comparison of the p53 genes in humans and elephants to uncover commonalities and differences. The project work includes interpreting DNA data, conducting a comparative analysis, and visualizing the outcomes

## Results
This function loads the DNA data in two p53 files, processes both into protein lists, generates a text report comparing the two genes (with a 0.5% cutoff for differences), and then generates a bar chart comparing the two genes (with the sufficiently different amino acids outlined in black)
