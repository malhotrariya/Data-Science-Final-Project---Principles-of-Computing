This project involves using data analysis to explore DNA sequences related to the p53 gene, known for its role in suppressing cancer. It included a comparison of the p53 genes in humans and elephants to uncover commonalities and differences. The project work includes interpreting DNA data, conducting a comparative analysis, and visualizing the outcomes.
